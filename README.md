## Motivations :
###Our primary motive for this project is to analyze the FIFA World Cup 2022 dataset to make predictions about future match ###outcomes.

###The dataset provides the date of each match, nominal data such as the home team, away team, and the continents of each. ###Additionally, it includes numerical data for the FIFA rankings and scores of the participating teams, totaling 25 ###columns and over 20,000 rows. Furthermore, the dataset has a perfect Kaggle usability score of 10.0, reflecting its ###completeness, credibility, and compatibility.
